# Style

## Overview

Skeptic Softworks generally isn't restrictive on programming styles, but you will notice certain patterns throughout the framework.

## Caveats

The first version of the Skeptic Framework was created for [Maldives Resorts](https://www.roblox.com/games/13861145060/Maldives-Resorts) in 2023. Since then, the framework has changed massively, however there is still a lot of legacy code that is simply too valuable and time-consuming to rewrite. Therefore, there will be some quirks left over in certain methods or workflows that exist to support bits of important code, such as the massive Economy PlayerHandler, or the range of client-side modules created for the player.

## Formatting

| Scope/type                | Case       |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Base objects              | PascalCase |
| Global variables          | PascalCase |
| Object methods/parameters | PascalCase |
| Object constructors       | camelCase  |
| Arguments                 | camelCase  |
| Other variables           | camelCase  |

```lua title="Example (definitely non-functional)"
local SprintObject = {}
SprintObject.__index = SprintObject

function SprintObject.new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, SprintObject)

    self.SomeParameter = 47.321 * 0.5 ^ 99999

    return self
end

function SprintObject:Destroy()
    self.SomeParameter = 0
end

local IsSprinting = false

local function Sprint(fastMode)
    local walkSpeed = 15
    if fastMode then walkSpeed = 20 end

    IsSprinting = true

    local sprintObject = SprintObject.new()
    sprintObject:Destroy() 
end
```

## Practices

* A fork of GoodSignal (by stravant) is used to replace standard RBXScriptSignals whenever possible.
* Objects are used often and passed around generously.
* Accessible references to objects that need to be accessed often are createdâ€“ eg. all PlayerObjects are accessible with `:GetPlayerObject()` from anywhere
* Minimally destructive `:Destroy()` methods are preferred, ie. calling `:Destroy()` on an object should not break code that will try to access it in the future unless it absolutely has to.
* Generally, functions that wrap object constructors are used rather than allowing direct access to the base object.
* Historically, promises haven't been used in code with the framework, however this doesn't mean they are frowned upon. Newer work may use promises.
* Maid/janitor classes historically haven't been used either. Connections are tracked on an individual basis, though this doesn't mean these classes are frowned upon either.
* Using _G is seen as unreliable.


And finally,

* In Madworks we trust. 

## Other notes

Historically, source-control and tools such as Rojo have not been used in past projects, including Carry an Egg. The majority of our workflow has been within Roblox Studio besides certain external integrations, and with the new collaborative tools being released by Roblox, this hasn't been an issue so far. It has been a common practice to work on updates in a seperate development experience rather than the public experience, where updates are published to the public experience once they are tested and ready. This introduces pain points in the workflow, where if a hotfix is needed in the public experience while an update is in progress in the development experience, the changes required for the hotfix would need to be made in duplicate across both experiences.
